# Software Quality Matrix Methodology

This directory contains a reproducible, static assessment of the 23 repositories extracted under `/Users/pierrre/src.local/polkadot`.

## Files

- `repos.json` — repository inventory (language, build system, test frameworks).
- `collect.py` — static collector and scoring engine.
- `execute_quality.py` — execution-based checker that runs tests, coverage and benchmarks.
- `scores.json` — machine-readable scores per repository.
- `matrix.md` — human-readable heat-map matrix.
- `README.md` — this methodology document.

## Prerequisites

`execute_quality.py` dispatches the native toolchain for each repository. Make sure the following tools are installed and on `PATH`:

| Tool | Needed for | How to install | Homebrew (macOS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo` + `rustc` | Rust repositories | [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) | `brew install rustup` then `rustup-init` |
| `cargo-llvm-cov` | Rust coverage reports | `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov` (also needs LLVM tools: `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`) | `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov` |
| `npm` / `pnpm` | TypeScript repositories | Bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) / `npm install -g pnpm` | `brew install node pnpm` |
| `bun` | TypeScript repositories using Bun | `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash` (see [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)) | `brew install bun` |
| `forge` + `cast` + `anvil` | Solidity repositories (Foundry) | `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz \| bash` then run `foundryup` (see [Foundry docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)) | Not available in Homebrew; use the official installer above |
| `gradle` or `./gradlew` | Android/Kotlin repositories | [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) or the wrapper; also requires a working Android SDK for native tests | `brew install gradle` and `brew install --cask android-studio` |
| `xcodebuild` | iOS/Swift repositories | Install Xcode from the Mac App Store or Apple Developer portal | `brew install --cask xcode` |

If a tool is missing, `execute_quality.py` will log the failure and move on; the repository will keep its static score and coverage will be reported as N/A.

## Approach

The chosen approach is **Option A: Lightweight Static + Heuristic**. No full test suites were executed because of heterogeneous toolchains, long build times, and missing runtime dependencies. Instead, the collector inspects:

- file-system structure (`tests/`, `benches/`, `docs/`, `.github/workflows/`);
- source and test-file counts;
- configuration files (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `deny.toml`, lint configs);
- lightweight regex/AST heuristics for design patterns and doc comments;
- CI workflow categories.

**Coverage values are N/A** unless a badge or coverage artifact is present. To obtain real percentages, run the appropriate toolchain for each repository (see Coverage section below).

## Scoring Dimensions

All dimensions are scored **0–5**, except unit-test coverage which is reported as a percentage when available.

| Dimension | What it measures | How it is computed |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit Tests** | Density of unit-test code relative to source code. | Rust: count of `#[test]` attributes per `.rs` file. TS/JS: count of `describe`/`it`/`test` blocks in `*.test/spec.ts`. Solidity: count of `*.t.sol` files. Kotlin: `test/**/*.kt` files. Swift: `*Tests.swift` files. |
| **Integration / E2E Tests** | Presence and CI enforcement of integration or end-to-end tests. | Detects `integration-tests/`, `integration_tests/`, `e2e-tests/`, `e2e/` directories and corresponding CI workflows. |
| **Documentation** | Completeness of human-readable docs. | Checks README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, SECURITY/CODE_OF_CONDUCT, `docs/` directory, API-doc tooling, and doc-comment ratio. |
| **Architecture** | Modularity and separation of concerns. | Workspace/module count, ADRs/architecture docs, average source-file size, monorepo structure. |
| **Design Patterns** | Deliberate use of idiomatic abstractions. | Rust: traits/enums/Result/Option usage. TS: interfaces/abstract classes/service layers. Solidity: interfaces/proxy/access-control. Mobile: MVVM/repository patterns. |
| **Benchmarks** | Performance regression testing. | Presence of `benches/`/`benchmarks/` directories, `criterion`, `frame-benchmarking`, or benchmark CI workflows. |
| **CI Maturity** | Breadth of automated pipelines. | One point each for test, lint, security, release/deploy, and performance/coverage/mutation workflows. |
| **Static Analysis** | Linting and formatting enforcement. | Presence of lint/format configs and matching CI enforcement. |
| **Dependency Security** | Supply-chain risk controls. | `deny.toml`, Dependabot config, security workflows. |
| **Maintainability** | Long-term project health signals. | CODEOWNERS, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, issue/PR templates, release automation. |
| **Type Safety** | Strength of static type guarantees. | Rust/Kotlin/Swift = 5 by default. TypeScript depends on `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`. Solidity depends on static-analysis tooling. |
| **Test Pyramid Balance** | Healthy mix of unit vs integration tests. | Ratio of unit test files to integration/e2e directories. |
| **Mutation / Fuzz** | Deeper verification beyond line coverage. | Fuzz targets, mutation workflows, property-based testing (fast-check). |

## Weighting

The overall score is a weighted average of the dimensions above:

| Dimension | Weight |
|---|---|
| Unit Tests | 0.15 |
| Integration / E2E Tests | 0.10 |
| Documentation | 0.10 |
| Architecture | 0.10 |
| Design Patterns | 0.10 |
| Benchmarks | 0.08 |
| CI Maturity | 0.08 |
| Static Analysis | 0.07 |
| Dependency Security | 0.07 |
| Maintainability | 0.05 |
| Type Safety | 0.05 |
| Test Pyramid Balance | 0.03 |
| Mutation / Fuzz | 0.02 |

Weights can be adjusted by editing the `overall_score` function in `collect.py` and re-running.

## Additional Quality Parameters

Beyond the dimensions explicitly requested by the user, the matrix includes seven extra parameters that are easy to compute and add valuable signal:

1. **CI/CD Maturity** — breadth of automated checks (test, lint, security, release, perf).
2. **Static Analysis / Linting** — config presence and CI enforcement.
3. **Dependency Security / Freshness** — `deny.toml`, Dependabot, security audits.
4. **Maintainability / Bus Factor** — CODEOWNERS, changelog, templates, release automation.
5. **Type Safety / Static Guarantees** — strict TypeScript, Rust ownership, static analysis.
6. **Test Pyramid Balance** — distribution of unit vs integration vs e2e tests.
7. **Mutation / Fuzz Testing** — fuzz targets, mutation workflows, property-based tests.

## How to Generate Real Coverage

To replace the N/A coverage values with actual percentages, run the appropriate tool per ecosystem:

- **Rust**: `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov` or `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --out Xml`
- **TypeScript (vitest)**: `vitest run --coverage`
- **TypeScript (jest)**: `jest --coverage`
- **Solidity (Foundry)**: `forge coverage`
- **Kotlin/Android**: `./gradlew jacocoTestReport`
- **Swift/iOS**: `xcodebuild test -enableCodeCoverage YES`

Then update `coverage_value` in `collect.py` to parse the generated artifacts and re-run.

## Re-running the Analysis

Generate static scores only:

```bash
cd /Users/pierrre/src.local/polkadot/quality-matrix
python3 collect.py
```

Run tests, coverage and benchmarks and merge the results into the matrix (resumes from `execution_results.json` if interrupted):

```bash
cd /Users/pierrre/src.local/polkadot/quality-matrix
python3 execute_quality.py
```

## Limitations

- Scores are based on static signals, not runtime behavior.
- Architecture and design-pattern scores are heuristic; they indicate structural conventions, not true design quality.
- Coverage is N/A for repositories where the test toolchain could not run; see the per-repo coverage notes in `matrix.md`.
- Mobile repositories may be under-scored if test conventions differ from the heuristics used.
